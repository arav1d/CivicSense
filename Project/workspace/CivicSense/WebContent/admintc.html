The administrator ensures that our system works as a well oiled machine.The activities like filtering<br/>
the invalid complaints are done by the administrator.The citizens can expect better response from the<br/>
authority by issuing their feedback.Administrator views the feedback form the users.Based on this,we make<br/>
sure that a memo is issued to the respective authority to enhance their service.Creating authority accounts<br/>
is  automated by the administrator. It may be a relatively simple task for him or her to do, but acknowledging the<br/>
work your administrators do for you can go a long way when you need their help on something bigger.</p>
